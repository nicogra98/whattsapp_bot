Na-na-na-na, everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like
Na-na-na-na, everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, Deluga Heights (replay)
Hey over and over if I'm tipsy or sober
I got lil' momma on rewind like the deck in my Rover
On my mind, shawty fine, meditate her like yoga
So down on the line make me want a cold soda
Hey baby be my radio
Hear you everywhere I go
Music in my head
Know your melody in every note
Girl you incredible
Make yourself available
Na-na-na-na, that tune so exceptional
Sexy like a piano give you my hands if you're ready
We can make plans get body stand if you let me
Girl I'm a fan chasing my boss like catch me
I ain't a fight she gon arrest me
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like

See you been all around the globe
Not once did you leave my mind
We talk on the phone, from night 'till the morn
Girl, you really changed my life
Doin' things I never do
I'm in the kitchen cookin' things she likes
We're real worldwide, breaking all the rules
Someday I wanna make you my wife
That girl, like somethin' off a poster
That girl, is a dime they say
That girl, is a gun to my holster
She's running through my mind all day, ay
Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like
Na-na-na-na, everyday
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay-ay

Oh, girl I could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
So come baby girl, let's sing with me, ay

Oh, girl I could write you a symphony
The one that could fill your fantasies
